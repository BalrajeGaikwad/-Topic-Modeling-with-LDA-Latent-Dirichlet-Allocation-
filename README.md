**🧠 Topic Modeling with LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)**

This project demonstrates the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Topic Modeling using the LDA algorithm (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) with the Gensim library. The goal is to automatically identify hidden thematic structures (topics) in a collection of text documents related to the harmful effects of sugar on health.

**📌 Project Objective**
To analyze a set of textual documents and uncover the underlying topics using the LDA algorithm. Each document is treated as a mixture of topics, and each topic as a mixture of words. The project showcases how to preprocess text data, build an LDA model, and interpret the topics.

**📂 Dataset Description**
The input dataset consists of several sentences collected from Atkins research articles, discussing the negative impact of sugar on the human body. These documents mention how sugar affects mood, cravings, and hunger.

**🔧 Key Features**
✅ Text preprocessing using NLTK:
- Stopword removal
- Lemmatization
- Punctuation cleaning

✅ Tokenization and Document-Term Matrix creation using Gensim

✅ Topic modeling using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)

✅ Displaying top keywords for each topic

✅ Optional: Visualizing topics using pyLDAvis

**🛠️ Libraries Used**
- Python
- Gensim
- NLTK
